<h1>OpenVas scan for vulnerability</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
The project involves two virtual machines: Kali Linux (with the IP address 10.0.2.8) and Metasploitable (with the IP address 10.0.2.15). An authenticated scan was executed using OpenVAS from the Kali Linux VM, targeting the Metasploitable VM, and a report was generated to identify vulnerabilities.
<br />


<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Terminal</b> 
- <b>OpenVas</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Kali Linux</b> 
- <b>Ubuntu Linux</b>

<br />
<br />
Format the output, and print out the dictionary that we need:  <br/>

<br />
<br />


The final output is a dictionary that filters out error codes 403 and 404 along with their associated IP addresses and error code counts. The output shows only 2 counts of the 403 error but significantly more counts of the 404 error, with a notable 60 counts of 404 errors from IP address 208.91.156.11.  <br/>

<h1>Use Bash to automate file backup  </h1>
<br />
Bash Script is used to back up file member_data.txt, Iâ€™ve incorporated a timestamp into the script. This means the filename will bear a new timestamp each time a backup is made, the new file will be saved in /home/Autobackup directory:  <br/>

<br />
<br />

Next, we are creating a Cron job to schedule and automate this backup process Every Wednesday at 12:00 AM. First, we use nano to edit crontab, add the cron command:0 0 * * 3 / home/student/bashbackup.sh:  <br/>

<br />

With these Bash scripts, the system will automatically backup file member_data.txt Every Wednesday at 12:00 AM and save it to the Autobackup directory with a new time stamp.
